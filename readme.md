This is an example on how to run a gitlab-pipeline (you know this gitlab-ci.yml)
thingy locally.

Its just a poc - but could be used for more. Especially as this doesn't require
gitlab to be run...

you need gitlab-runner (the binary for that). Get it through your package manager
e.g _brew install gitlab-runner_ , from here https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlab-runner
or from here https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-runner/tags
